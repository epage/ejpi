		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
		The interface focuses on history manipulation and quick access to functionality through something like pie menus. It takes advantage of pythons type system under the hood for support of integer, float, and complex operations. For integers it tracks the base used and tries to persist that through the operations.
		</p>

		<p>The name (e^(j pi) + 1 = 0, or shortened ejpi) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulers_identity">Euler's Identity</a>.  If you do not understand the beauty of it, I recommend reading the article.  Why "j"?  I come from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit#Alternative_notations">engineering background</a>.  Yeah, it put a smile on my face when I learned Python and found out it used "j".</p>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">RPN</a>?  I've just always been a fan of its simplicity to understand, simplicity to code, uniformity in action, less mental tracking, etc.  Yes, I own several HP calculators.</p>

		<p>ejpi has been tested on Ubuntu 9.05, Maemo 5, and Maemo 4.1</p>

		<h4>Features</h4>
		<p>ejpi v0.9.4 (See <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?p=260919#post260919">t.m.o Thread</a>)</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Pie Menu like system for buttons: Quick access to functionality without cluttering the display</li>
			<li>History manipulation: Just drag the items around, click on the "x" to delete individual items, click on the entered equation or the result to copy it, etc</li>
			<li>Persistent history</li>
			<li>Plugin system:  Add all the constants or custom equations you want</li>
			<li>Tracks numbers as integers (with base), floating point numbers, and complex numbers</li>
			<li>Comes by default with some basic operations, logic operations, and trig</li>
			<li>Keyboard shortcuts:
			<ul>
				<li>Ctrl+enter to toggle fullscreen</li>
				<li>Ctrl+l to copy debug logs to the clipboard</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<p>ejpi v1.0.0 on Ubuntu</p>
			<p>Notice the tracking of base through the operations.  Just prefix your number with the appropriate prefix (see poorly named "Computer" tab)</p>
			<p>Notice Each square has a value in the middle and is sometimes surrounded by others.  Just clicking on the button will cause the center item's operation to be performed.  Click and drag will in the direction of any of the other symbols will cause that operation to occur.  Note: Not all click-and-drag symbols are shown by default so explore a bit.</p>
